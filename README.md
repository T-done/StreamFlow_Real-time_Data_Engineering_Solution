# StreamFlow: Real-time Data Engineering Solution

### Introduction

This project guides you in building an end-to-end data engineering pipeline. It covers data ingestion, processing, and storage using Apache Airflow, Kafka, Spark, and Cassandra, all containerized with Docker for easy deployment.
System Architecture

### Components:

    Data Source: randomuser.me API
    Apache Airflow: Orchestrates and stores data in PostgreSQL.
    Apache Kafka and Zookeeper: Streamlines data to the processing engine.
    Control Center and Schema Registry: Manages Kafka streams.
    Apache Spark: Processes data.
    Cassandra: Stores processed data.
